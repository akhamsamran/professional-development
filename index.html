			<h3>How I use my whole brain</h3>
			<p><strong>I use my whole brain in my job at NCM: I can see how the end products will need to be used, can empathize with how the users/students and staff will have to interact with these products, and can set up systems to make it work most effectively and easily for users. I think of myself of the bridge between practical and comfortable. For example, if it is decided that the College needs to change its pricing structure, I figure out what things that will change withing the office administratively, what forms will need to be changed, who it will affect of current students and future students, what new issues will need to be addressed on the phone when talking to prospective students, etc...
