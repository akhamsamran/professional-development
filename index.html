			<h3>How I use my whole brain</h3>
			<p><strong>I use my whole brain in my job at NCM: I can see how the end products will need to be used, can empathize with how the users/students and staff will have to interact with these products, and can set up systems to make it work most effectively and easily for users. I think of myself of the bridge between practical and comfortable. For example, if it is decided that the College needs to change its pricing structure, I figure out what things that will change withing the office administratively, what forms will need to be changed, who it will affect of current students and future students, what new issues will need to be addressed on the phone when talking to prospective students, etc...

			<h3>Elevator Pitch</h3>
			<p><strong>Version 1</strong></p>
			<p>Hi, my name is Anna, I truly believe that most people truly have the best of intentions for themselves and others, but lack access to the information they need to make these choices. I am working on an app that will allow voters to access the platforms and individual stances on all politicians. Are you doing anything in the area of searchable databases for political issues?</p>
			<p><strong>Version 2</strong></p>
			<p>Hello, I am Anna Khamsamran, I would like to enable apprentices and preceptors to meet and verify experiences through the internet. I am creating an app that allows this. Would your school be interested in such a project?
			</p>
			<h4>Points for Elevator Pitch:</h4>
				<ul>
					<li>What do you do?</li>
				<li>What makes you unique?</li>
				<li>How do you do it and who does it affect?</li>
			</ul>

			<h2>Weekly Reflections</h2>
			<br>
			<h3>Week 1</h3>
			<p>The first week: We started off with an overview of the program and expectations.</p>
			<p> The first day has been spent in an introduction to "Lexicon" (vocabulary/glossary), "Vitae" including information on two important people having to do with computer engineering, "Knowledge Base," focused on Style Guidelines for HTML, PHP and MySql. </p>
			<p>I have determined that I am a Visual Learner by taking the test to determine my Learning Style at: <a href="http://www.educationplanner.org/students/self-assessments/learning-styles.shtml" >Education Planner Assessment</a></p>
			<p>I continue to think deeply on who do I want to be and what do I want to do using:[what[how[why]how]what]</p>
			<p>[<strong>what[how[why</strong>-make peoples' lives better by cutting out things that cause confusion(based on the belief that with the benefit of technology and clearly available information, people will make better decisions for themselves, neighbors, country, world)<strong> ]how]what:</strong>make apps that do this in various areas, medical records, voting, etc<strong>];</strong></p>
			<p>I have been working on updating my old resume to a tech resume for my future. I have added a page for the resume to professional-development, and added a link to the living document at the top of this page </p>
			<p>After listening to @quay17 's presentation, I began to find a bit of clarity in myself for the future in terms of identifying things I definitely do not like doing and am trying to embrace the things that I do like doing, and trying to imagine how to bring my current talents and joys into my new coding skills.  Quay shared a svg course with me and we talked about animating svg in websites.  It made me remeber an artist who makes digital cards: something <a href="https://www.jacquielawson.com/">J.Lawson</a> I need to talk to Karen and Daniel to see if they have any ideas to help me to pursue this.</p>
			<p>At the end of week 1 I am feeling much more confident with basic setup of html and css files.  MySQL tables, entities, relationships, attributes, etc are making sense to me, still need work on actually working in MySQL within PhpStorm</p>

			<h3>Week 2</h3>
			<p>This week was MySQL and PHP </p>
			<p>We learned how to write tables(classes) for databases in mysql, and then to write php for the classes to tell them how to display the data held within them, and how to add data to them, while checking for security issues and errors.  I feel very confident with the MySQL structure and how to use the commands to create and edit them.  I am starting to feel confident with my recognition of the structure of the PHP code.  Obviously more practice will make this better.</p>
			<p>In the PWP project, I have completed several versionjs of wireframes, and am still not sure if I am done with it.</p>
			<p>I am struggling to change my resume into something that appears to show that I do lots of little stuff, instead of a few big things.  Will continue playing with this until it is both true and looks good.</p>

			<h3>Week 3:</h3>
			<p>Questions:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>What are internal and external factors keeping you from achieving your goal?
					<ul>
						<li><strong>answer:</strong></li>
						<li>0. I do not have a college education (external). 1. I have not committed to a goal(internal). 2. I actually do not know what my goal specifically is(this translates to both external and internal).</li>
						<li>Additionally, although I have many skills, I do not know how to market them, and when I do find someone who wants them, they usually do not have the money to pay me for them.  These are definitely the wrong kind of client, but I am absolutely stumped as to how to find a paying client or a job that wants to pay me.  It is completely terrifying to think that even with more skills (being a full-stack developer) that I will still have this particular problem.</li>

					</ul></li>
				<li>How do personally create value for others?
					<ul>
						<li><strong>answer:</strong></li>
						<li>I have the talent of being able to see what problem I could solve for others.  I can see the way structure and practical changes can cause improvement to the outcome they are seeking. I can work well with others to find the logo/design/etc that they are seeking, even if they don't know they need it.</li>

					</ul></li>
				<li>Has anyone ever told you that you got potential professionally? Do you believe it? Why, Why not?
					<ul>
						<li><strong>answer:</strong></li>
						<li>There are two sides to this: 1. I have often been told that I have potential, and I do believe them, and I am extremely competent.  I even have proof of my professional talent, as evinced by my success with my own business and with the College I work for.</li>
						<li>HOWEVER, 2. I do get anxiety about finding new jobs.</li>
					</ul></li>
			</ul>
			<h5>Week 3 reflections</h5>
			<p>This week has been a roller coaster of ups and downs: The downs have been caused by 1. Professional Development (Resume and marketing of self, that makes me a little bit anxious.  As for learning PHP and Javascript: Sometimes I feel like I have to  figure out what animal we are talking about from an in-depth discussion of a toenail. It is slow, but I think I will get it. </p>
			<p>The ups this week have been "a-ha" moments when some topic has suddenly slid into place in my structural/visual understanding of the topics, and my sureness in my competency in mySQL databases. Also the growing understanding that my ability to see structure and patterns serves me well in connecting PHP to mySQL databases.  Another bright point has been working on the design of my wireframe for the PWP. This has been very fun.  Rochelle is a great teacher, and it is a relief to learn CSS and front-end with her, as it is very straightforward and visual, which matches my learning style.  I am incredibly thankful that Dylan is willing and able to take on any question and to examine things from any angle, and to humor what must be ridiculously naive questions from all of us students.  He has encouraged me that I will be a good candidate to take the ZEND certification course, since I understand databases and structure. Also, most important, I have realized what great support my fellow students are.</p>
			<p> The presentations on friday afternoon were good and I came away feeling like my eyes had been opened to the oppoprtunities within the tech industry in Albuquerque.</p>
