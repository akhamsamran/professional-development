			<h3>How I use my whole brain</h3>
			<p><strong>I use my whole brain in my job at NCM: I can see how the end products will need to be used, can empathize with how the users/students and staff will have to interact with these products, and can set up systems to make it work most effectively and easily for users. I think of myself of the bridge between practical and comfortable. For example, if it is decided that the College needs to change its pricing structure, I figure out what things that will change withing the office administratively, what forms will need to be changed, who it will affect of current students and future students, what new issues will need to be addressed on the phone when talking to prospective students, etc...

			<h3>Elevator Pitch</h3>
			<p><strong>Version 1</strong></p>
			<p>Hi, my name is Anna, I truly believe that most people truly have the best of intentions for themselves and others, but lack access to the information they need to make these choices. I am working on an app that will allow voters to access the platforms and individual stances on all politicians. Are you doing anything in the area of searchable databases for political issues?</p>
			<p><strong>Version 2</strong></p>
			<p>Hello, I am Anna Khamsamran, I would like to enable apprentices and preceptors to meet and verify experiences through the internet. I am creating an app that allows this. Would your school be interested in such a project?

			<h2>Weekly Reflections</h2>
			<br>
			<h3>Week 1</h3>
			<p>The first week: We started off with an overview of the program and expectations.</p>
			<p> The first day has been spent in an introduction to "Lexicon" (vocabulary/glossary), "Vitae" including information on two important people having to do with computer engineering, "Knowledge Base," focused on Style Guidelines for HTML, PHP and MySql. </p>
			<p>I have determined that I am a Visual Learner by taking the test to determine my Learning Style at: <a href="http://www.educationplanner.org/students/self-assessments/learning-styles.shtml" >Education Planner Assessment</a></p>
			<p>I continue to think deeply on who do I want to be and what do I want to do using:[what[how[why]how]what]</p>
			<p>[<strong>what[how[why</strong>-make peoples' lives better by cutting out things that cause confusion(based on the belief that with the benefit of technology and clearly available information, people will make better decisions for themselves, neighbors, country, world)<strong> ]how]what:</strong>make apps that do this in various areas, medical records, voting, etc<strong>];</strong></p>
			<p>I have been working on updating my old resume to a tech resume for my future. I have added a page for the resume to professional-development, and added a link to the living document at the top of this page </p>
			<p>After listening to @quay17 's presentation, I began to find a bit of clarity in myself for the future in terms of identifying things I definitely do not like doing and am trying to embrace the things that I do like doing, and trying to imagine how to bring my current talents and joys into my new coding skills.  Quay shared a svg course with me and we talked about animating svg in websites.  It made me remeber an artist who makes digital cards: something <a href="https://www.jacquielawson.com/">J.Lawson</a> I need to talk to Karen and Daniel to see if they have any ideas to help me to pursue this.</p>
			<p>At the end of week 1 I am feeling much more confident with basic setup of html and css files.  MySQL tables, entities, relationships, attributes, etc are making sense to me, still need work on actually working in MySQL within PhpStorm</p>

			<h3>Week 2</h3>
			<p>This week was MySQL and PHP </p>
			<p>We learned how to write tables(classes) for databases in mysql, and then to write php for the classes to tell them how to display the data held within them, and how to add data to them, while checking for security issues and errors.  I feel very confident with the MySQL structure and how to use the commands to create and edit them.  I am starting to feel confident with my recognition of the structure of the PHP code.  Obviously more practice will make this better.</p>
			<p>In the PWP project, I have completed several versionjs of wireframes, and am still not sure if I am done with it.</p>
			<p>I am struggling to change my resume into something that appears to show that I do lots of little stuff, instead of a few big things.  Will continue playing with this until it is both true and looks good.</p>
