			<h3>How I use my whole brain</h3>
			<p><strong>I use my whole brain in my job at NCM: I can see how the end products will need to be used, can empathize with how the users/students and staff will have to interact with these products, and can set up systems to make it work most effectively and easily for users. I think of myself of the bridge between practical and comfortable. For example, if it is decided that the College needs to change its pricing structure, I figure out what things that will change withing the office administratively, what forms will need to be changed, who it will affect of current students and future students, what new issues will need to be addressed on the phone when talking to prospective students, etc...

			<h3>Elevator Pitch</h3>
			<p><strong>Version 1</strong></p>
			<p>Hi, my name is Anna, I truly believe that most people truly have the best of intentions for themselves and others, but lack access to the information they need to make these choices. I am working on an app that will allow voters to access the platforms and individual stances on all politicians. Are you doing anything in the area of searchable databases for political issues?</p>
			<p><strong>Version 2</strong></p>
			<p>Hello, I am Anna Khamsamran, I would like to enable apprentices and preceptors to meet and verify experiences through the internet. I am creating an app that allows this. Would your school be interested in such a project?
			</p>
			<p><strong>Version 3:</strong></p>
			<p>[what[how[why]how]what]</p>
			<p>Why: Peopleâ€™s lives can be made better by easy access to well organized information/Improving businesses and the experience of their customers</p>
			<p>what:Building systems and tools that remove obstacles to access </p>
			<p>How: Do you have a business that could benefit from a better method of communication with customers?</p>

			<h4>Points for Elevator Pitch:</h4>
				<ul>
					<li>What do you do?</li>
				<li>What makes you unique?</li>
				<li>How do you do it and who does it affect?</li>

			<h2>Weekly Reflections</h2>
			<br>
			<h3>Week 1</h3>
			<p>The first week: We started off with an overview of the program and expectations.</p>
			<p> The first day has been spent in an introduction to "Lexicon" (vocabulary/glossary), "Vitae" including information on two important people having to do with computer engineering, "Knowledge Base," focused on Style Guidelines for HTML, PHP and MySql. </p>
			<p>I have determined that I am a Visual Learner by taking the test to determine my Learning Style at: <a href="http://www.educationplanner.org/students/self-assessments/learning-styles.shtml" >Education Planner Assessment</a></p>
			<p>I continue to think deeply on who do I want to be and what do I want to do using:[what[how[why]how]what]</p>
			<p>[<strong>what[how[why</strong>-make peoples' lives better by cutting out things that cause confusion(based on the belief that with the benefit of technology and clearly available information, people will make better decisions for themselves, neighbors, country, world)<strong> ]how]what:</strong>make apps that do this in various areas, medical records, voting, etc<strong>];</strong></p>
			<p>I have been working on updating my old resume to a tech resume for my future. I have added a page for the resume to professional-development, and added a link to the living document at the top of this page </p>
			<p>After listening to @quay17 's presentation, I began to find a bit of clarity in myself for the future in terms of identifying things I definitely do not like doing and am trying to embrace the things that I do like doing, and trying to imagine how to bring my current talents and joys into my new coding skills.  Quay shared a svg course with me and we talked about animating svg in websites.  It made me remeber an artist who makes digital cards: something <a href="https://www.jacquielawson.com/">J.Lawson</a> I need to talk to Karen and Daniel to see if they have any ideas to help me to pursue this.</p>
			<p>At the end of week 1 I am feeling much more confident with basic setup of html and css files.  MySQL tables, entities, relationships, attributes, etc are making sense to me, still need work on actually working in MySQL within PhpStorm</p>

			<h3>Week 2</h3>
			<p>This week was MySQL and PHP </p>
			<p>We learned how to write tables(classes) for databases in mysql, and then to write php for the classes to tell them how to display the data held within them, and how to add data to them, while checking for security issues and errors.  I feel very confident with the MySQL structure and how to use the commands to create and edit them.  I am starting to feel confident with my recognition of the structure of the PHP code.  Obviously more practice will make this better.</p>
			<p>In the PWP project, I have completed several versionjs of wireframes, and am still not sure if I am done with it.</p>
			<p>I am struggling to change my resume into something that appears to show that I do lots of little stuff, instead of a few big things.  Will continue playing with this until it is both true and looks good.</p>

			<h3>Week 3:</h3>
			<p>Questions:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>What are internal and external factors keeping you from achieving your goal?
					<ul>
						<li><strong>answer:</strong></li>
						<li>0. I do not have a college education (external). 1. I have not committed to a goal(internal). 2. I actually do not know what my goal specifically is(this translates to both external and internal).</li>
						<li>Additionally, although I have many skills, I do not know how to market them, and when I do find someone who wants them, they usually do not have the money to pay me for them.  These are definitely the wrong kind of client, but I am absolutely stumped as to how to find a paying client or a job that wants to pay me.  It is completely terrifying to think that even with more skills (being a full-stack developer) that I will still have this particular problem.</li>

					</ul></li>
				<li>How do personally create value for others?
					<ul>
						<li><strong>answer:</strong></li>
						<li>I have the talent of being able to see what problem I could solve for others.  I can see the way structure and practical changes can cause improvement to the outcome they are seeking. I can work well with others to find the logo/design/etc that they are seeking, even if they don't know they need it.</li>

					</ul></li>
				<li>Has anyone ever told you that you got potential professionally? Do you believe it? Why, Why not?
					<ul>
						<li><strong>answer:</strong></li>
						<li>There are two sides to this: 1. I have often been told that I have potential, and I do believe them, and I am extremely competent.  I even have proof of my professional talent, as evinced by my success with my own business and with the College I work for.</li>
						<li>HOWEVER, 2. I do get anxiety about finding new jobs.</li>
					</ul></li>
			</ul>
			<h5>Week 3 reflections</h5>
			<p>This week has been a roller coaster of ups and downs: The downs have been caused by 1. Professional Development (Resume and marketing of self, that makes me a little bit anxious.  As for learning PHP and Javascript: Sometimes I feel like I have to  figure out what animal we are talking about from an in-depth discussion of a toenail. It is slow, but I think I will get it. </p>
			<p>The ups this week have been "a-ha" moments when some topic has suddenly slid into place in my structural/visual understanding of the topics, and my sureness in my competency in mySQL databases. Also the growing understanding that my ability to see structure and patterns serves me well in connecting PHP to mySQL databases.  Another bright point has been working on the design of my wireframe for the PWP. This has been very fun.  Rochelle is a great teacher, and it is a relief to learn CSS and front-end with her, as it is very straightforward and visual, which matches my learning style.  I am incredibly thankful that Dylan is willing and able to take on any question and to examine things from any angle, and to humor what must be ridiculously naive questions from all of us students.  He has encouraged me that I will be a good candidate to take the ZEND certification course, since I understand databases and structure. Also, most important, I have realized what great support my fellow students are.</p>
			<p> The presentations on friday afternoon were good and I came away feeling like my eyes had been opened to the oppoprtunities within the tech industry in Albuquerque.</p>
			<p>New Resume completed for review </p>
			<li></li>

			<h3>Week 4:</h3>
			<h5>Forbidden Island Reflections:</h5>
			<p>Firstly I love my team.  So far (only 1 day) we have worked enthusiastically and synergistically together.  Each team member has a very distinctive personality and interaction style within the team. It would be fun for each of us to do a myers-briggs personality test.</p>
			<p>Ken: An introvert perfectionist, quick on his feet. Thinks several steps ahead.  Happy to take the lead, to take responsibility, dependable, intense.</p>
			<p>Tristan: An extrovert, very smart, good at math and logic, can also think complexly and several steps ahead, like Ken.  Doesn't mind taking the lead. Less inclined to volunteer to take responsibility for requirements, but quite dependable.</p>
			<p>Freddy: A mystery...shy or just quiet. I will have to wait to see who he turns out to be.  He is a team player, happy to join in and be part of the team.  I don't know yet about how his mind works, but he he seems involved and engaged. So far has not taken any lead, but I am not counting him out... so far very pleasant.</p>
			<p>Me... I am happy to take the lead and sometimes play the part of big sister.  I have plenty of questions and comments and ideas to add to planning. I am comfortable jumping in and taking on responsibility. It is good that other members of the team are as excited as I am and as interactive, so I don't have to be the boss.  So far we seem to be able to take turns and listen to eachother. In Forbidden Is. I noticed that both Tristan and Ken immediately grasped the game, while I kept having to check back on the instructions. We all seemed to be very careful in planning. I worry that the three of us don't leave space for Freddy to speak.  I will work on this.</p>
			<h5>Online Identities:</h5>
			<p>I have Twitter, Linked-in, stack-overflow, Cafepress</p>
			<h5>Submitted Orgs:</h5>
			<p>nonprofit: <a href="http://www.emergenm.org/" alt="emerge nm" >Emerge New Mexico (nonprofit to encourage democratic women to try to get elected to public positions)</a></p>
				<p>For-profit: <a href="https://talinmarket.com/" alt="talin market">Talin Market</a></p>
			<h5>Direct and Indirect initiatives to find work after bootcamp:</h5>
			<p> Direct: I asked Franzisca if whe would allow me to interview with her for a job after bootcamp was over.  I found a mentor for business-an entrepreneur in town. I am excited to work with him, and perhaps he will let me make a website for him. Indirect: I made temporary business cards with my current email. will order higher quality ones once I know my PWP web address and email.I also worked on a logo for myself, which I like</p>
			<h5>Reflections for week 4</h5>
			<p>I finally understood the format of Dylan's Snap Challenges: I had thought it was ridiculous to challenge us with something no-one could do.  On Wednesday morning's snap-challenge, We were asked to do something that we could partially do, and then when Dylan went to explain it, he added tons of stuff, that would be absolutely unrealistic that we ever could have figured out.  So then my flash of understanding was that the challenge focuses us on a problem, and we try (even completely incorrectly to address it any way we can).The point is not to get it right, but just to get us focused on the problem, and then Dylan uses this opportunity to teach us on the topic, using actual examples.  The snap-challenge is just an opening to a lesson.  I still think that sometimes these lessons are so beyond us, that we are left feeling stupefied, but now that I understand the process I am much impressed with the methodology- Yes! there is a method to the madness!</p>
			<p> I had a great meeting with Dan and have incorporated his recommendations to the <a href="annakhamsamran-resume.pdf">6th version of my resume</a>. I'm still working on my elevator pitch, somehow I totally have lost the difference between how, what and why :)</p>
			<p>I very much enjoyed the presentations this Friday, by Noel, who gave us great personal experience of working freelance,and Franzisca, who's systems- oriented approach that binds the technical and artistic aspects of design together really speaks to me.  I listen to Dan and took the direct approach and told her I would love it if she would allow me to interview ith her for a job after bootcamp was finished.</p>
			<p>Our team is having too much fun together, so we have made some rules for communication so that we can all keep on having fun.  Here are a few we agreed upon: restate question, if it is getting too esoteric/advanced/or just stops making sense, call for a step down in intensity of discussion and restate in another way, call out people for a sanity break when you notice it's needed, check-in when appropriate, hard stop at midnight, everything silenced by 10pm, always happy to help others.</p>
			<p>I had an adventure this week with my computer having problems communicating with GitHub for the capstone project. I was unable to get any credit for any of the work I contributed to it on GitHub for 3 days, and had to email pieces of my work to my teammates instead of just pushing it to the repository.  Neither George, nor Rochelle, nor Marty, not Dylan could get it to work, so I changed to my mac, and spent a whole night re-doing the pre-work to set it up.  There were a few hiccups, but it now seems to work.  I have spent hours re-cloning my repositories from GitHub(and am still not done), I have to email all the images from my other computer. I don't have my art programs on the Mac, which means I have to use both computers at class.  This is tiring and frustrating, but hopefully at some point I'll be able to transfer everything.</p>
